After flashing the SD-Card and setting your google account
please install SambaDroid and Terminal Emulator.

##### Default WLAN Chip #####

Default WLAN is Realtek 8192cu. You can switch to another Realtek chip
8188eu
8189es
8192eu
8723as
8723au

You only use a pc and a serial cable or do it on the bpi with the app Terminal
Emulator. Type:

root@android:/ # wlan
###### Change default WLAN-Chip ######
Folder of libhardware_legacy.so is: /system/lib/libhardware_legacy
Actually used WLAN driver is: 8192cu
1 libhardware_legacy-8188eu.so
2 libhardware_legacy-8189es.so
3 libhardware_legacy-8192eu.so
4 libhardware_legacy-8723as.so
5 libhardware_legacy-8723au.so
Enter the number of the file: 
3
Make partition sdx7 writable
Make partition sdx7 read only
WLAN driver switched from 8192cu to 8192eu
To have an effect, reboot is necessary!
For reboot type y!

Ready!
root@android:/ #

With the app Terminal Emulator you first must type su for root rights!

##### Default Audio Output Mode #####

Like WLAN but type:

root@android:/ # audio
###### Default Audio Output ######
## h=AUDIO_HDMI / c=AUDIO-CODEC ##
###### or audio h / audio c ######
h
Default is AUDIO_HDMI
root@android:/ #

After changing reboot is necessary!

With the app SambaDroid you can control all! How it works, have a look to /system/etc/mkshrc!

##### SATA #####
A sata hdd formatted in ext4 will automatically mounted in /mnt/sata.

##### Keyboard and mouse #####

The input device can handle a mouse with five buttons. Left button ok/forward,
middle button menu, right button back, side left 1 home and side left 2 mute.
Tested with the Medion wireless keyboard / 5 button mouse and with the Logilink
wireless keyboard / 5 button mouse. The Logitech K400 I can't test, but the driver LOGITECH_DJ
is compiled within the kernel.

##### Busybox #####

There are two command boxes:
/sbin/busybox, the original build busybox, BusyBox v1.23.1
/system/bin/busybox is a link to /sbin/busybox
/system/bin/toolbox is the original Android toolbox, some apps need it!
/system/xbin/busybox, here are the applets from the BusyBox v1.23.1

Try the difference between:
ifconfig
ifconfig wlan0
/system/xbin/busybox ifconfig or the same is /system/xbin/ifconfig

##### Special Commands #####

There are some useful commands in the folder /system/xbin

## audio ## Audio mode

## auto ##  Kodi autostart by the mkshrc during booting and start kodi new, if unwanted finished,
or manually

root@android:/ # auto
########## auto started, but wait for android ##########
########## auto is active ##########
Starting: Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN cmp=org.xbmc.kodi/.Splash }

To stop it during booting use the app ShutDown and wait until the info message is closed,
you have 30 sec time, or after closed kodi also use ShutDown and wait until the info message is closed.

## sdx ## Makes the system partition sdx7 writable or only read

root@android:/ # sdx
